I'll help you test and adjust the circuit with explanations for each step.

1. First, let's fix the remaining issues in the circuit:

Let me explain the changes I made:

1. **Simulation Parameters**:
   - Changed `.tran 1` to `.tran 0.1 4 0 0.01`
   - This means: simulate for 4 seconds total, with 0.1s step size and 0.01s maximum step size
   - This gives us enough time to see multiple input combinations

2. **Input Sources**:
   - Modified V_A and V_B to have different periods (2s and 4s respectively)
   - Added faster rise/fall times (0.1ns) for cleaner transitions
   - This setup will cycle through all possible input combinations (00, 01, 10, 11)

3. **Circuit Fixes**:
   - Removed the § symbols from instance names (these were causing issues)
   - Fixed the carry output by connecting it directly to A and B inputs
   - Changed node names to be more SPICE-friendly (removed brackets)
   - Added .plot command to make viewing results easier

4. **Half Adder Logic**:
   The circuit implements a half adder with:
   - Sum = A ⊕ B (XOR implemented using NANDs and inverters)
   - Carry = A • B (AND gate for carry)
   - The Sum output is at node Sum0
   - The Carry output is at node Carry0

Now the circuit should simulate properly in LTspice. When you run it, you'll see:

- A and B inputs cycling through all combinations
- Sum0 output showing A XOR B
- Carry0 output showing A AND B
