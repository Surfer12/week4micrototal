Let me help analyze and structure your computer architecture and adder implementation task. Given your academic background and current focus on C and C++, I'll approach this with an emphasis on hardware-software integration concepts.

Based on the provided documentation and requirements, let's structure your implementation process:

1. **Initial Design Phase**
   - Focus on the simplified block with carry-in=0 first
   - Create separate truth tables for SUM and CARRY-OUT
   - Derive Boolean expressions using SOP method

2. **LTSpice Implementation**
   - Create basic circuit implementation
   - Generate block symbol
   - Design test schematic
   - Run comprehensive simulations

3. **LSB Block Optimization**
   - Design simplified LSB block (no carry-in)
   - Create symbol for LSB block
   - Test and verify functionality
   - Replace original LSB block with optimized version

Given your background in biopsychology and interest in system integrations, would you like me to dive deeper into any specific aspect of this implementation plan? I can provide detailed guidance on:

1. Truth table construction and verification
2. LTSpice simulation setup and analysis
3. Boolean expression optimization
4. Integration testing methodology

Which area would you like to explore first?
