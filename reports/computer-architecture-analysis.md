## Complete Adder Implementation {{hardware_design}}

### Structure Overview

- The complete adder is implemented as part of a larger computer architecture
- Utilizes ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) for addition operations
- Incorporates register file for temporary storage
- Features data memory for operand storage

### Detailed Adder Design

1. **Half Adder Implementation**

   ```
   Truth Table:
   A  B  | Sum  Carry
   0  0  |  0    0
   0  1  |  1    0
   1  0  |  1    0
   1  1  |  0    1
   ```

2. **Gate-Level Implementation**
   - XOR gate for Sum calculation
   - AND gate for Carry generation
   - NAND-based implementation for optimization
   - Optimized LSB block (Carry-in = 0)

3. **Boolean Expressions**

   ```
   Sum = A ⊕ B
   Carry = A • B
   NAND Implementation: 
   Sum = (A NAND A) NAND (B NAND B)
   Carry = NOT(A NAND B)
   ```

### Instruction Set Architecture

The computer implements a basic instruction set with the following formats:

1. **Instruction Formats**

   ```

   STORE: 10 Reg[2:0] | DataMem Address
   ```

2. **Program Example**

   ```
   LOAD R0 0 -> 11 000 X 00
   LOAD R1 1 -> 11 001 X 01
