# Computer Architecture Analysis

## Complete Adder Implementation {{hardware_design}}

### Structure Overview

- The complete adder is implemented as part of a larger computer architecture
- Utilizes a 4-bit Carry-Lookahead Adder (CLA) within the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) for addition operations
- The ALU takes two 4-bit inputs, A and B, and a control signal (AddSub) to select between addition and subtraction
- Incorporates a register file for temporary storage of operands and results
- Features data memory for operand storage

### Detailed Adder Design

1. **Half Adder Implementation**

   ```
   Truth Table:
   A  B  | Sum  Carry
   0  0  |  0    0
   0  1  |  1    0
   1  0  |  1    0
   1  1  |  0    1
   ```

2. **Full Adder Implementation**

   - **Inputs and Outputs:**
     - A = First input bit
     - B = Second input bit
     - Cin = Carry input from previous stage
   - **Outputs:**
     - Sum = Final sum output (A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin)
     - Cout = Carry output to next stage ((A • B) + Cin(A ⊕ B))

   - **Truth Table:**

     | A | B | Cin | Sum | Cout |
     |---|---|-----|-----|------|
     | 0 | 0 | 0   | 0   | 0    |
     | 0 | 0 | 1   | 1   | 0    |
     | 0 | 1 | 0   | 1   | 0    |
     | 0 | 1 | 1   | 0   | 1    |
     | 1 | 0 | 0   | 1   | 0    |
     | 1 | 0 | 1   | 0   | 1    |
     | 1 | 1 | 0   | 0   | 1    |
     | 1 | 1 | 1   | 1   | 1    |

   - **Boolean Expressions:**

     ```
     Sum = A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin
     Cout = (A • B) + Cin(A ⊕ B)

     NAND Implementation:
     Sum = NAND(NAND(A ⊕ B, Cin), NAND(A ⊕ B, NAND(Cin, Cin)))
     Cout = NAND(NAND(A, B), NAND(Cin, A ⊕ B))
     ```

     2. **Signal Flow:**

        ```
        First Half Adder:
        - Inputs: A, B
        - Outputs: Sum1, Carry1

        Second Half Adder:
        - Inputs: Sum1, Cin
        - Outputs: FinalSum, Carry2

        Final Carry:
        - Cout = Carry1 OR Carry2
        ```

## Computer Architecture {{computer_design}}

### Instruction Set Architecture

The computer implements a basic instruction set with the following formats:

1. **Instruction Formats**

   All instructions are 8 bits wide with the following format:

   ```
   ADD:   00 Dest[2:0] X Src[1:0]  ; Add source register to destination register
   SUB:   01 Dest[2:0] X Src[1:0]  ; Subtract source from destination register
   LOAD:  11 Reg[2:0] X Addr[1:0]  ; Load from memory address to register
   STORE: 10 Reg[2:0] X Addr[1:0]  ; Store register to memory address
   ```

   Where:
   - First 2 bits: Opcode (00=ADD, 01=SUB, 10=STORE, 11=LOAD)
   - Next 3 bits: Register specifier (Dest/Reg)
   - 1 bit: Reserved/unused (X)
   - Last 2 bits: Source register or memory address

2. **Program Example**

   ```
   LOAD R0 0 -> 11 000 X 00  ; Load value from memory address 0 into R0
   LOAD R1 1 -> 11 001 X 01  ; Load value from memory address 1 into R1
   ADD R3 R0 R1 -> 00 011 X 00  ; Add R0 and R1, store result in R3
