# State Machines Analysis

## Key Terms {{terminology}}

- **LTSpice State Machines**: Feature in LTSpice allowing definition of finite state machines within circuit simulations
- **Contraption Programming Language**: Mini programming language used to model sequential logic behavior
- **.machine Directives**: Core syntax elements (.machine, .endmachine) that define state machine blocks
- **States**: Declared with .state command, representing distinct modes of operation
- **Transitions/Rules**: Defined by .rule statements specifying state changes and conditions
- **Outputs**: Controlled current sources defined by .output statements
