TimingAnalysis = [If applicable, note the critical path or propagation delay]
; e.g., "Worst-case propagation: a change on A or B travels through two gates (AND then OR) to affect F, whereas a change on C travels through NOT then OR. Assuming each gate has similar delay, the critical path is two gates long. No hazards/glitches were observed as all inputs feed combinational gates with proper synchronization (see Propagation Delay in Glossary)."

; e.g., F = A·B + ¬C·B (from our example), which is the form implemented by the circuit.
; Note: This section ensures the logical expression of the circuit is fully simplified and correct. It should confirm that the expression derived (via K-Map or SOP) is indeed the most reduced form and is logically equivalent to the original specification. This final expression is the one realized in [Gate Operations].

[Glossary]
AND Gate = Logic gate that outputs 1 (true) only if **all** its inputs are 1 ([What is a truth table? – TechTarget Definition](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/truth-table#:~:text=AND)). (Logical conjunction; symbol ∧ or &)
OR Gate  = Logic gate that outputs 1 if **at least one** input is 1 ([What is a truth table? – TechTarget Definition](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/truth-table#:~:text=OR)). (Logical disjunction; symbol ∨ or +)
NOT Gate = Logic gate that outputs the logical **negation** of its input (outputs 1 if input is 0, and vice versa) ([What is a truth table? – TechTarget Definition](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/truth-table#:~:text=NOT)). (Inversion; symbol ¬ or ! or ')
Logic 1 (HIGH) = The higher logic level in binary (e.g., True, "1", high voltage level) representing boolean true.
Logic 0 (LOW)  = The lower logic level (e.g., False, "0", low voltage level) representing boolean false.
Truth Table = A table listing all possible combinations of input values and the corresponding output for a logic function ([Truth table - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table#:~:text=A%20truth%20table%20is%20a,For%20example%20for%20a%20binary)). Used to define the behavior of the logic circuit exhaustively.
Karnaugh Map (K-Map) = A graphical method for simplifying Boolean expressions by organizing truth table values into a grid, allowing common terms to be combined ([](https://www.jetir.org/papers/JETIR2501591.pdf#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20The%20Karnaugh%20Map%20%28K,up%20to%20six%20variables%2C%20with)). It helps reduce logic expressions to minimal form ([](https://www.jetir.org/papers/JETIR2501591.pdf#:~:text=K,required%20in%20practical%20circuit%20implementations)).

verify_minimal_expression = (✔/❌) ; The K-map result is a minimal expression (no further reduction possible, no redundant groups). (Comment: ___)
verify_expression_correct = (✔/❌) ; The simplified expression from K-map produces the same output as the original truth table (validated by checking key input cases or re-deriving truth table from it). (Comment: ___)

[Gate Operations]
; Define the logic gates implementing the simplified expression:
Gate1 = [Gate type and inputs -> output]
; e.g., G1: AND gate with inputs A and B, output = X (implements X = A ∧ B).
Gate2 = [Gate type and inputs -> output]
; e.g., G2: NOT gate with input C, output = Y (implements Y = ¬C).
Gate3 = [Gate type and inputs -> output]
; e.g., G3: OR gate with inputs X and Y, output = F (implements F = X + Y).
GateOperationNotes = [Any additional info about gate behavior/timing]
; e.g., All gates are assumed ideal for logic levels (output transitions occur after a small propagation delay ([Propagation delay - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_delay#:~:text=Logic%20gates%20%20can%20have,r%7D%20are%20given))). If timing is critical, note propagation delays or if this is a synchronous circuit, note clocking.
; Note: The above gates realize the expression from [K-Map Reduction] (F = X + Y in the example) using standard logic symbols from [Notation Key]. Each gate’s logical function (AND, OR, NOT) is defined in the Glossary (e.g., AND gate outputs 1 only if all inputs are 1 ([What is a truth table? – TechTarget Definition](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/truth-table#:~:text=AND))).

; ✔/❌ Verification:
verify_gates_complete = (✔/❌) ; All parts of the simplified Boolean expression are implemented by the listed gates (no missing term or signal). (Comment: ___)

verify_timing_addressed = (✔/❌) ; Any necessary timing considerations (propagation delay, gate switching speed) are noted and acceptable for the design. (Comment: ___)

[Circuit Diagram Representation]
DiagramIllustration = [Reference or description of the circuit diagram]
; (In an actual document, this could be an embedded schematic image or ASCII diagram of the circuit. e.g., a drawn logic diagram with gates labeled G1, G2, G3 as above.)
DiagramNotation = [Explanation of diagram symbols/legends]
; e.g., AND/OR/NOT gate shapes per standard, dots on lines for junctions, distinctive symbols for inputs and outputs as defined in Notation Key.
DiagramLabels = [List of labeled signals in diagram]
; e.g., label inputs (A, B, C), outputs (F), and intermediate nodes (X, Y) corresponding to the Gate Operations.
; Note: The circuit diagram provides a visual confirmation of the [Gate Operations]. It should use the symbols from [Notation Key] and reflect the connections described (e.g., output of G1 feeds one input of G3, etc.).

; ✔/❌ Verification:
verify_diagram_accuracy = (✔/❌) ; Diagram matches the gate-level implementation (all gates and connections correspond to those listed in Gate Operations). (Comment: ___)

[Full Signal Analysis]
; Analyze signal propagation and node equations in the circuit:

OutputEquation = [Boolean equation for output in terms of nodes or inputs]
; e.g., F = X + Y (which, when expanded, matches the simplified Boolean expression).
PropagationSteps = [Describe the sequence of signal propagation through the circuit]
; e.g., "Inputs A,B feed AND gate -> X. Input C feeds NOT gate -> Y. Then X and Y feed OR gate -> F. Thus, a change in A or B propagates through G1 then G3 to F; a change in C propagates through G2 then G3."
TimingAnalysis = [If applicable, note the critical path or propagation delay]
; e.g., "Worst-case propagation: a change on A or B travels through two gates (AND then OR) to affect F, whereas a change on C travels through NOT then OR. Assuming each gate has similar delay, the critical path is two gates long. No hazards/glitches were observed as all inputs feed combinational gates with proper synchronization (see Propagation Delay in Glossary)."
; Note: This analysis verifies that each intermediate node’s logic (node equations) and the timing of signal changes produce the correct final output as specified in the [Truth Table]. It ties the static logic design to dynamic behavior (propagation).

; ✔/❌ Verification:
verify_node_logic = (✔/❌) ; Every intermediate node equation is consistent with the intended logic and the overall Boolean expression. (Comment: ___)
verify_propagation_correctness = (✔/❌) ; For each input scenario, following the signal path through nodes yields the correct output (matches truth table – ensures no logical discrepancies at any stage). (Comment: ___)

[SOP Reduction]
InitialSOP = [Sum-of-Products expression derived from the truth table]
; e.g., list of minterms: F = A·B·¬C + A·B·C + ... (each term corresponds to an input combination where output=1 in the Truth Table).
ReductionSteps = [Algebraic reduction steps applied to simplify the SOP]
; e.g., combine terms using Boolean algebra theorems:
;   F = A·B·¬C + A·B·C  -> factor A·B: F = A·B(¬C + C)
;   -> simplify (¬C + C = 1): F = A·B
;   (show step-by-step simplification of the SOP expression).
ReducedSOP = [Final minimized SOP expression]
; e.g., F = A·B + ¬C·B (the simplified sum-of-products form, which should match the K-Map result).
; Note: This section provides an algebraic simplification of the Sum-of-Products derived from the Truth Table. The final result should coincide with the expression from [K-Map Reduction], confirming the minimization is correct.

; ✔/❌ Verification:
verify_all_minterms_used = (✔/❌) ; Initial SOP includes all required minterms for output=1 (covers every truth table case where F=1). (Comment: ___)
verify_algebraic_steps = (✔/❌) ; Boolean algebra steps are correctly applied (each simplification step is valid). (Comment: ___)
verify_sop_matches_kmap = (✔/❌) ; The reduced SOP expression matches the simplified result from K-Map Reduction (thus both methods agree on final expression). (Comment: ___)

InitialExpression = [Original Boolean expression before simplification]
; e.g., starting expression from requirements or the full SOP expression before reduction.
TargetExpression = [Target (simplified) Boolean expression]
; e.g., the expected simplified expression (from K-Map or known simplest form).
ReductionTechnique = [Method used for reduction]
; e.g., algebraic manipulation, applying identities (consensus theorem, De Morgan’s law, etc.) to reach the simplified form.
ReductionProof = [Proof or validation of equivalence]
; e.g., a brief statement: "Verified equivalence by truth table comparison or Boolean algebra proof showing initial expression equals simplified expression."
FinalBooleanExpression = [The final simplified Boolean expression for the design]
; e.g., F = A·B + ¬C·B (from our example), which is the form implemented by the circuit.
; Note: This section ensures the logical expression of the circuit is fully simplified and correct. It should confirm that the expression derived (via K-Map or SOP) is indeed the most reduced form and is logically equivalent to the original specification. This final expression is the one realized in [Gate Operations].

; ✔/❌ Verification:
verify_equivalence_proven = (✔/❌) ; Demonstrated that the initial and final expressions are equivalent (via truth table or symbolic proof). (Comment: ___)
verify_expression_minimal = (✔/❌) ; The final Boolean expression is simplified to minimal terms/literals (no further simplification possible). (Comment: ___)
verify_consistency_final = (✔/❌) ; The final expression aligns with the implemented circuit (the gates in the design realize this expression) and with the truth table outputs. (Comment: ___)

[Glossary]
AND Gate = Logic gate that outputs 1 (true) only if **all** its inputs are 1 ([What is a truth table? – TechTarget Definition](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/truth-table#:~:text=AND)). (Logical conjunction; symbol ∧ or &)
OR Gate  = Logic gate that outputs 1 if **at least one** input is 1 ([What is a truth table? – TechTarget Definition](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/truth-table#:~:text=OR)). (Logical disjunction; symbol ∨ or +)
NOT Gate = Logic gate that outputs the logical **negation** of its input (outputs 1 if input is 0, and vice versa) ([What is a truth table? – TechTarget Definition](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/truth-table#:~:text=NOT)). (Inversion; symbol ¬ or ! or ')
Logic 1 (HIGH) = The higher logic level in binary (e.g., True, "1", high voltage level) representing boolean true.
Logic 0 (LOW)  = The lower logic level (e.g., False, "0", low voltage level) representing boolean false.
Truth Table = A table listing all possible combinations of input values and the corresponding output for a logic function ([Truth table - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table#:~:text=A%20truth%20table%20is%20a,For%20example%20for%20a%20binary)). Used to define the behavior of the logic circuit exhaustively.
Karnaugh Map (K-Map) = A graphical method for simplifying Boolean expressions by organizing truth table values into a grid, allowing common terms to be combined ([](https://www.jetir.org/papers/JETIR2501591.pdf#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20The%20Karnaugh%20Map%20%28K,up%20to%20six%20variables%2C%20with)). It helps reduce logic expressions to minimal form ([](https://www.jetir.org/papers/JETIR2501591.pdf#:~:text=K,required%20in%20practical%20circuit%20implementations)).

Each product term corresponds to a combination of inputs that yields output 1.
Boolean Expression = An algebraic expression composed of boolean variables and logic operators (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) representing a logic function. E.g., F = A·B + ¬C.
