I'll look into whether Cursor by Anysphere has dedicated LTSpice extensions and explore general methods for enabling SPICE syntax highlighting within Cursor. Additionally, I'll provide detailed steps on how to import a SPICE UDL (XML file) into Cursor for syntax highlighting if applicable.

# SPICE/LTSpice Syntax Highlighting in Cursor (Anysphere AI Editor)

## SPICE/LTSpice Support in Cursor

**Built-in vs. Extension:** *Cursor* (by Anysphere) doesn’t include native LTSpice or SPICE syntax highlighting out-of-the-box. There is no dedicated “LTSpice” extension pre-installed. However, Cursor is built on Visual Studio Code’s architecture ([Anysphere reportedly raises $100M for its AI-driven Cursor code editor - SiliconANGLE](https://siliconangle.com/2024/12/20/anysphere-reportedly-raises-100m-ai-driven-cursor-code-editor/#:~:text=Anysphere%E2%80%99s%20code%20editor%2C%20Cursor%2C%20is,sections%20of%20a%20code%20file)) and can leverage VS Code language extensions ([Cursor - The AI Code Editor](https://www.cursor.com/#:~:text=,Cursor%20is%20SOC%202%20certified)). This means you can add general SPICE language support (which covers LTSpice netlists) via third-party extensions or custom definitions.

**General SPICE Extensions:** Instead of a Cursor-specific LTSpice plugin, you can use a VS Code SPICE language extension. These extensions provide syntax highlighting for SPICE netlist languages (including LTSpice’s variant) ([

](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bzisjo.vscode-spice-support#:~:text=SPICE%20Language%20Support%20for%20VS,Code)). In practice, they highlight standard SPICE elements (components like R, C, V, etc.), SPICE directives/commands (e.g. `.subckt`, `.tran`, `.MODEL`), and comments ([
        SPICE - Visual Studio Marketplace
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xuanli.spice#:~:text=Done)). This covers LTSpice’s netlist syntax since LTSpice is largely compatible with standard SPICE netlists. (For example, `.tran`, `.ac`, `.meas` statements, etc., used in LTSpice are highlighted by a general SPICE grammar ([
        SPICE - Visual Studio Marketplace
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xuanli.spice#:~:text=,Snippets)).)

**Dedicated LTSpice Extension:** There isn’t an official “LTSpice-specific” extension from Anysphere. Instead, the general SPICE language extensions are used. These extensions typically support **various SPICE dialects** – one Sublime Text package notes it works with “standard SPICE, HSpice, Spectre, SpiceOpus and probably others” ([leoheck/sublime-spice: SPICE for Sublime Text - GitHub](https://github.com/leoheck/sublime-spice#:~:text=SPICE%20,SpiceOpus%20and%20probably%20others)), which implies broad compatibility (LTSpice’s dialect is essentially “standard SPICE” with some minor additions). In summary, you should install a SPICE syntax-highlighting extension in Cursor to get LTSpice netlists colorized.

## Enabling SPICE Syntax Highlighting in Cursor

There are two main ways to enable SPICE/LTSpice syntax highlighting in Cursor: using a VS Code extension (recommended for most users) or adding a custom user-defined language grammar. Below are methods for each approach.

### **1. Using a VS Code SPICE Extension (Recommended)**

Since Cursor supports VS Code extensions ([Anysphere reportedly raises $100M for its AI-driven Cursor code editor - SiliconANGLE](https://siliconangle.com/2024/12/20/anysphere-reportedly-raises-100m-ai-driven-cursor-code-editor/#:~:text=Anysphere%E2%80%99s%20code%20editor%2C%20Cursor%2C%20is,sections%20of%20a%20code%20file)), the easiest solution is to install an existing SPICE language extension:

- **Choose a SPICE Extension:** Two popular options are **“SPICE” by Xuan Li** (over 40k installs) and **“SPICE Language Support” by Jonathan Wang** ([
        SPICE - Language Support - Visual Studio Marketplace
  ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bzisjo.vscode-spice-support#:~:text=SPICE%20Language%20Support%20for%20VS,Code)). These extensions provide SPICE syntax highlighting and basic snippets. For example, Xuan Li’s *SPICE* extension highlights SPICE netlist files: it covers comment toggling and coloring for component lines (`R...`, `C...`, `V...` etc.), SPICE directives (`.subckt`, `.end`, `.tran`, etc.), and includes snippets for common analyses ([
        SPICE - Visual Studio Marketplace
  ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xuanli.spice#:~:text=Done)). Either extension will work for LTSpice netlists (LTSpice uses the same `.tran/.ac/.meas` commands, component notation, and comment syntax as standard SPICE, which these extensions recognize).

- **Installation in Cursor:** Install the chosen extension in Cursor just as you would in VS Code:
  1. **Via UI/Marketplace:** Open Cursor’s extensions panel (usually the puzzle piece icon on the sidebar). Search for “SPICE” – you should find the extension (e.g. **“SPICE” by Xuan Li**). Click **Install**. *(Cursor can use VS Code’s marketplace or a similar repository to fetch extensions, and it can also import your existing VSCode extensions ([Cursor - The AI Code Editor](https://www.cursor.com/#:~:text=,Cursor%20is%20SOC%202%20certified)).)*  
  2. **Via Command Palette:** Alternatively, press <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P</kbd>, select “Extensions: Install Extensions” (or simply type `ext install xuanli.spice` for Xuan Li’s extension). This will download and enable the SPICE language support in Cursor.  
  3. **Manual VSIX (if needed):** If the above methods don’t work (for example, if Cursor’s marketplace access is disabled), you can manually install the extension. Download the extension’s `.vsix` file from the Visual Studio Marketplace or its GitHub. In Cursor, use the command palette option “**Install from VSIX…**” and select the downloaded file. Another manual method is to copy the extension files into Cursor’s extensions folder – on Windows, for instance, copy the extension’s folder from `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions` into `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\extensions` ([Migrating Extensions from Windows to Cursor.AI not working - Discussion - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/migrating-extensions-from-windows-to-cursor-ai-not-working/22493#:~:text=How%20are%20you%20trying%20to,the%20settings%20and%20extensions%20from)), then restart Cursor.

- **Verify Syntax Highlighting:** Once installed, open an LTSpice netlist file (e.g. a `.cir`, `.sp`, `.net` or `.lib` file). The SPICE extension will automatically detect common SPICE file extensions and apply the language mode. (The Notepad++ SPICE UDL, for example, registers `.lib`, `.cir`, `.mod` as SPICE file types ([GitHub - hildogjr/Notepad-plus-plus--languages: Notepad++ highlighting languages (SPICE & RPN/RLP/Lisp/HP50g)](https://github.com/hildogjr/Notepad-plus-plus--languages#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20user,for%20Spice%20Circuit%20Description%20language)); the VSCode extension similarly covers typical SPICE extensions.) You should immediately see colored syntax: component identifiers, node numbers, and directives in distinct colors. Comments (lines starting with `*` or `;`) will be italicized or colored as comment color, etc., as defined by the extension’s grammar.

- **File Association (if needed):** If your netlist file has a non-standard extension, you may need to manually set the language mode. In Cursor’s bottom status bar, click the language name (e.g. “Plain Text”) and select “SPICE” as the language for that file. You can also add a setting in Cursor’s settings JSON to associate custom file extensions with the SPICE language (using `files.associations`). However, for standard LTSpice netlist files (`.cir`, `.net`) this shouldn’t be necessary since the extension will recognize them.

Once the extension is enabled, Cursor will treat SPICE netlists like any other supported language – providing syntax highlighting and even comment toggling or basic intellisense if the extension includes it. For example, you can use the regular comment shortcut (<kbd>Ctrl + /</kbd>) to add/remove `*` comments in SPICE files, thanks to the extension’s comment toggling support ([
        SPICE - Visual Studio Marketplace
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xuanli.spice#:~:text=Done)).

### **2. Importing a SPICE UDL (Custom Grammar Definition)**

If you already have a User-Defined Language (UDL) XML file for SPICE (for example, a Notepad++ UDL for LTSpice netlists) and want to use that, you’ll need to convert it into a format Cursor/VSCode understands. Cursor doesn’t have a one-click “import UDL” feature, so this approach involves creating a custom language grammar extension. This is a bit advanced, but possible. Here’s how to proceed:

**Step 1: Convert UDL to a TextMate Grammar.** Visual Studio Code uses TextMate grammars for syntax highlighting definitions (typically `.tmLanguage` XML or JSON files). You cannot directly import a Notepad++ UDL XML into VS Code, but you can translate its rules into a TextMate grammar:

- If you have access to an existing SPICE TextMate grammar, use it as a starting point. For example, the Sublime Text SPICE package by Leo Heck provides TextMate-compatible syntax rules ([
        SPICE - Visual Studio Marketplace
    ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xuanli.spice#:~:text=SPICE%20support%20for%20VSCode)). You could obtain its grammar file (e.g. `Spice.tmLanguage` from that project) instead of writing one from scratch.
- Alternatively, use the Notepad++ UDL as a reference to manually create a `.tmLanguage` file. The UDL XML defines keywords, comment markers, etc., which you’d reformat into TextMate grammar patterns. (TextMate grammars are XML/JSON with regex patterns for tokens – the VS Code docs have examples of how to define scopes and patterns for keywords, comments, numbers, etc.)

**Step 2: Scaffold a VS Code Language Extension.** Create a minimal VS Code extension that introduces “SPICE” as a language and includes your grammar:

- An easy way is using VS Code’s Yeoman template for new languages. On a system with Node.js, install Yeoman and the VS Code Extension Generator, then run `yo code` and choose “New Language” ([Syntax Highlight Guide | Visual Studio Code Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide#:~:text=To%20quickly%20create%20a%20new,option)). When prompted, you can provide a name (e.g. “ltspice” or “spice”), an identifier, file extension defaults (like `.cir`, `.net`), and **specify an existing grammar file** if you have one ([Syntax Highlight Guide | Visual Studio Code Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide#:~:text=match%20at%20L384%20When%20asked,TextMate%20grammar%20file)). Yeoman will scaffold the extension structure for you.  
- The scaffold will include a `package.json` and a `syntaxes` folder. If you didn’t supply the grammar in the generator, place your converted `*.tmLanguage` (or `.tmlanguage.json`) file into the `syntaxes` folder and update `package.json` accordingly. In the `package.json`, under the `"contributes"` field, define a language entry (with an **ID**, a **name**, and file extensions) and a grammar entry pointing to your grammar file with a scope name. For example, you might have:  

    ```json
    "contributes": {
      "languages": [{
         "id": "spice-netlist",
         "aliases": ["SPICE Netlist","Spice"],
         "extensions": [".cir", ".net", ".sp"],
         "configuration": "./language-configuration.json"
      }],
      "grammars": [{
         "language": "spice-netlist",
         "scopeName": "source.spice",
         "path": "./syntaxes/Spice.tmLanguage"
      }]
    }
    ```

    This tells VS Code (and Cursor) to use your `Spice.tmLanguage` for files ending in `.cir`, `.net`, etc. The scope name `source.spice` should match the top-level scope in your .tmLanguage file.

**Step 3: Install the custom extension in Cursor.** After creating the extension:

- If you used Yeoman, you can test it in VS Code first (run the extension in VS Code’s Extension Host to ensure the highlighting works). Then package it by running `vsce package` in the extension’s project folder, which will output a `.vsix` file.  
- Install the .vsix into Cursor using the command palette or UI (“Install from VSIX…” as described earlier). Cursor will treat your custom extension like any other.  
- **Alternatively**, you can manually copy the extension folder to Cursor’s extension directory. For example, copy the entire project folder into `~/.cursor/extensions/` (on Windows, `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\extensions`) ([Migrating Extensions from Windows to Cursor.AI not working - Discussion - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/migrating-extensions-from-windows-to-cursor-ai-not-working/22493#:~:text=How%20are%20you%20trying%20to,the%20settings%20and%20extensions%20from)). After restarting Cursor, it should load your custom language extension.

**Step 4: Activate and test the UDL-based highlighting.** Open an LTSpice netlist file in Cursor and ensure it’s recognized by your extension. If your file extensions match what you listed in `package.json`, Cursor should automatically use your “SPICE Netlist” language mode for those files. Verify that keywords, component names, and comments are colored as expected. You can tweak the colors by editing the theme or the scope names in your grammar (the extension uses whatever theme is active — it will apply theme colors to scopes like *keyword*, *comment*, *string* based on your grammar’s token naming).

**Note:** Creating a custom grammar is only necessary if you have very specific highlighting needs or a pre-existing UDL scheme you want to replicate exactly. In most cases, using the ready-made SPICE extension from the marketplace is faster and less error-prone. The VS Code SPICE extensions are actively used and likely cover all standard LTSpice syntax. But if you do go the custom route, the above steps will let you bring a UDL into Cursor’s environment (by essentially converting it into a VS Code extension).

## Summary & Key Points

- **No Native LTSpice Plugin:** Cursor doesn’t come with built-in LTSpice support, but it can use VS Code’s extension ecosystem ([Anysphere reportedly raises $100M for its AI-driven Cursor code editor - SiliconANGLE](https://siliconangle.com/2024/12/20/anysphere-reportedly-raises-100m-ai-driven-cursor-code-editor/#:~:text=Anysphere%E2%80%99s%20code%20editor%2C%20Cursor%2C%20is,sections%20of%20a%20code%20file)). No dedicated “Cursor LTSpice” extension exists, but general SPICE language extensions suffice for LTSpice netlists.
- **Third-Party Extensions:** Install a SPICE syntax-highlighting extension (e.g. “SPICE” by Xuan Li or “SPICE Language Support” by J. Wang) to get immediate highlighting for SPICE/LTSpice files ([
        SPICE - Language Support - Visual Studio Marketplace
  ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bzisjo.vscode-spice-support#:~:text=SPICE%20Language%20Support%20for%20VS,Code)) ([
        SPICE - Visual Studio Marketplace
  ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xuanli.spice#:~:text=Done)). This is the recommended and simplest solution. After installation, files with extensions like `.cir`, `.sp`, `.net` will automatically show highlighted SPICE syntax (resistors, capacitors, voltages, `.tran` commands, etc.) ([
        SPICE - Visual Studio Marketplace
  ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xuanli.spice#:~:text=,Snippets)) ([GitHub - hildogjr/Notepad-plus-plus--languages: Notepad++ highlighting languages (SPICE & RPN/RLP/Lisp/HP50g)](https://github.com/hildogjr/Notepad-plus-plus--languages#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20user,for%20Spice%20Circuit%20Description%20language)).
- **Custom UDL Import:** If you have a custom SPICE UDL (XML), you can convert it to a TextMate grammar and create a custom extension. While not “importable” directly, tools like VS Code’s Yeoman generator make it possible to scaffold a new language with an existing grammar file ([Syntax Highlight Guide | Visual Studio Code Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide#:~:text=To%20quickly%20create%20a%20new,option)) ([Syntax Highlight Guide | Visual Studio Code Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide#:~:text=match%20at%20L384%20When%20asked,TextMate%20grammar%20file)). You’d then install that into Cursor (via VSIX or by copying to the `.cursor/extensions` folder) to achieve the desired highlighting ([Migrating Extensions from Windows to Cursor.AI not working - Discussion - Cursor - Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/migrating-extensions-from-windows-to-cursor-ai-not-working/22493#:~:text=How%20are%20you%20trying%20to,the%20settings%20and%20extensions%20from)). This gives you full control, but involves several manual steps.
- **Result:** Once either method is set up, Cursor will provide proper syntax coloring for LTSpice netlists. This improves readability of circuit definitions, making comments, component lines, and simulation directives visually distinct – just like in other code files.

By following the above approaches, you can seamlessly edit and view LTSpice netlist files in Cursor with syntax highlighting, either by leveraging existing SPICE language support or by integrating your own UDL-based definition. ([
