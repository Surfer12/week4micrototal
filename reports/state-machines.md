# LTSpice State Machines – Principles, Applications, and Development Tools

## Understanding LTSpice State Machines

**LTSpice State Machines** are a feature in LTSpice (Analog Devices’ SPICE-based circuit simulator) that allow you to define arbitrary finite state machines within your circuit simulation. LTSpice XVII introduced this capability via a mini programming language (sometimes called the **Contraption** programming language) to model sequential logic behavior inside an analog simulation ([
        LTSpice State Machine - Visual Studio Marketplace
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TedKus.ltspice-state-machines#:~:text=LTspice%20XVII%20includes%20an%20arbitrary,There%20are%20five%20commands)). In essence, you can create a block of logic with defined states, transitions, and outputs that interacts with the rest of your circuit. These state machines operate on data structures using rules and functions, enabling an additional level of abstraction in simulations ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=ARBITRARY%20STATE%20MACHINE%20LTspice%20now,a%20state%20machine%20in%20LTspice)). This means you can encapsulate behaviors that have distinct modes or states (whether representing hardware logic or software-like algorithms) directly in LTSpice ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=LTspice%20now%20includes%20an%20arbitrary,a%20state%20machine%20in%20LTspice)).

A state machine in LTSpice is defined within `.machine ... .endmachine` directives as part of the netlist (or schematic directives) ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=explore%20the%20classic%20%E2%80%9Cdivide,the%20states%20makes%20no%20difference)). Inside this block, you declare a set of states and the logic for transitioning between them. LTSpice processes this state machine alongside the circuit simulation, checking transition conditions at each time step and updating the state accordingly. This allows the simulator to account for past history or sequential conditions – something not possible with pure combinatorial analog behavior – without needing external digital co-simulation.

## Working Principles of LTSpice State Machines

An LTSpice state machine is described by a small set of statements inside the `.machine` block ([
        LTSpice State Machine - Visual Studio Marketplace
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TedKus.ltspice-state-machines#:~:text=LTspice%20XVII%20includes%20an%20arbitrary,There%20are%20five%20commands)):

- **States**: Each state is declared with the `.state` command, giving it a name and an associated value. For example: `.state S0 0`. The value can be thought of as an output or code for that state (often a current level or logic level). The first `.state` listed is the initial state when simulation begins, but otherwise the order of state declarations doesn’t matter ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=Each%20state%20of%20the%20state,of%20expressions%20that%20evaluates%20if)). You can name states arbitrarily, making the definition readable (e.g., `.state IDLE 0`, `.state ACTIVE 1`, etc.), and assign a numeric value that might represent a logic output in that state ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=,of%20expressions%20that%20evaluates%20if)).

- **Transitions (Rules)**: State transitions are defined by `.rule` statements. A rule specifies an old state, a new state, and a condition under which the transition should occur:  
  `.rule <old_state> <new_state> <condition>` ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=The%20,rule%20expressions%20is)).  
  The condition is a boolean expression typically involving node voltages, currents, or logic expressions. Whenever the simulator evaluates that condition as true *while the machine is in the specified old state*, the machine will transition to the new state. There is no fixed limit to the number of rules you can have, and they are checked in the order they appear ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20limit%20to,Using%20the%20wildcard)). However, **only one rule can execute per simulation time step** (the first true condition in the list will cause its transition and others are ignored in that instant) ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20limit%20to,Using%20the%20wildcard)). This ensures deterministic behavior even if multiple conditions could be true at once.

  You can also define a rule with a wildcard `*` as the “old state”, meaning it applies from any state. This is useful for a **global transition** like a reset or emergency change. A wildcard rule is always evaluated with highest priority – if its condition is true, it “trumps” the other rules ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=The%20last%20command%20in%20the,next%20rule%20in%20the%20sequence)). For example: `.rule * RESET_STATE V(reset_pin) > 0.5` could force the machine into `RESET_STATE` whenever `reset_pin` goes high, regardless of the current state (this rule would be checked first) ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=the%20reset%20condition%20that%20uses,next%20rule%20in%20the%20sequence)).

- **Outputs**: The state machine can produce outputs using the `.output` statement. An output is written as a controlled current source from the state machine into a node:  
  `.output (<node>) <expression>` ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=.rule%20,source%2C%20it%20is%20not%20designed)).  
  The expression can depend on the current state or other logical conditions (for instance, it could output a certain current when in one state and a different current in another). Internally, LTSpice implements this as a current source, so to observe or use this output in the circuit you typically tie the output node to ground through a resistor (forming a voltage via Ohm’s law) ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=.rule%20,source%2C%20it%20is%20not%20designed)). In the state machine example documentation, a 1kΩ resistor to ground is used at the output node to convert the output current into a readable voltage level ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=.rule%20,output%20statement%20is)). The output expression can be as simple as a constant (representing a logic high or low current) or a conditional (e.g., using an IF statement) based on state. It’s important to note that while `.output` acts as a current source in the simulation, it’s **not meant to drive heavy loads** – it’s primarily for logic signaling within the simulation ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=capacitance,pin%20as%20in%20a%20current)).

- **Timing**: The state machine logic executes in sync with the simulation time steps. You can optionally specify a `tripdt` (time tolerance) on the `.machine` line (e.g., `.machine 1n`) which can be used to avoid very rapid state chattering by debouncing transitions within a certain time window ([
        LTSpice State Machine - Visual Studio Marketplace
  ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TedKus.ltspice-state-machines#:~:text=.mach%5Bine%5D%20%5B,ine%5D%20%3B%20end%20of%20block)). By default, transitions occur as soon as conditions are met, but `tripdt` can introduce a small required delay between state changes (this parameter is optional and typically not needed unless you encounter simulation timestep issues).

In practice, when the simulation runs, LTSpice continuously evaluates the `.rule` conditions. If a rule’s condition becomes true, the state machine changes state (at that simulation time) and stays in the new state until another rule triggers. Because only one transition can happen per time step, the machine will not, for example, rapidly oscillate between states within the same instant – a condition must persist into a new time step to trigger another change. This mechanism allows the rest of the analog circuit to respond to the state changes (and vice versa) in a time-consistent way.

## Applications and Use Cases of LTSpice State Machines

State machines in LTSpice are very powerful for simulating systems where **behavior changes over time based on past events or modes**. Instead of trying to do everything with analog components or idealized sources, you can use a state machine to represent logic and control flows. Some common applications and use cases include:

- **Digital Flip-Flops and Counters**: You can implement binary counters, toggles, or flip-flop behavior. A classic example provided by Analog Devices is a *divide-by-two counter with a reset* implemented as a state machine ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=abstraction%2C%20so%20they%20can%20provide,listed%20is%20the%20initial%20state)) ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=ARBITRARY%20STATE%20MACHINE%20LTspice%20now,a%20state%20machine%20in%20LTspice)). In this example, the state machine has two primary states representing the output (say output = 0 in one state and output = 1 in another). Each time an input clock signal crosses a threshold (e.g., a rising edge detection implemented by a voltage condition), the machine transitions to the other state, thus toggling the output. This effectively divides the input frequency by two. A wildcard reset rule can asynchronously force the machine back to the initial state if a reset signal goes high ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=The%20last%20command%20in%20the,next%20rule%20in%20the%20sequence)). Such an LTSpice state machine mimics the behavior of a T flip-flop or counter without needing to explicitly simulate transistor-level flip-flop circuits.

- **Analog-to-Digital Converter Control (SAR ADC example)**: In mixed-signal designs, you often need to coordinate analog and digital behavior. LTSpice state machines can model the sequencing logic of ADCs or DACs. For instance, a Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC has a finite state machine controlling the sampling and bit-by-bit conversion process. One user reported using the .machine feature to create a sampling FSM for a charge-redistribution SAR ADC ([LTspice State Machine - internal storage/variables? - Q&A - LTspice - EngineerZone](https://ez.analog.com/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice/f/q-a/105605/ltspice-state-machine---internal-storage-variables#:~:text=I%20am%20interested%20in%20using,parameters%20that%20can%20be%20calculated)). In their case, each state represented a step in the conversion process (sample, hold, compare, etc.), and transitions were triggered by a comparator’s output (bit decision) and a clock. This approach lets the analog front-end (capacitors, comparator, etc.) interface with a digital control algorithm all within the LTSpice simulation. It’s a clear example of modeling a mixed analog/digital process: the analog comparator’s result feeds the state machine, which then decides the next steps (like setting a bit and moving to the next bit’s comparison).

- **Power Supply or Regulator Control Logic**: Complex power regulators often have internal states (startup sequencing, normal regulation, fault protection modes like thermal shutdown or current limiting). Instead of building a full digital controller externally, one can use an LTSpice state machine to emulate the controller’s logic. For example, you could have states such as `STARTUP`, `RUN`, and `FAULT`. The machine could start in `STARTUP`, wait until an output voltage reaches a threshold, then transition to `RUN`. If an overcurrent condition is sensed, a rule could transition to `FAULT` state to model a shutdown. This way, you can test the power circuit’s response to various scenarios with a reasonably accurate digital control logic overlay.

- **Communication Protocol or Sequence Control**: While LTSpice isn’t a digital logic simulator per se, simple communication or control sequences can be approximated. Think of a scenario where you want to simulate a handshaking protocol or a multi-step gate driver timing sequence. By using states, you can enforce an order of operations. For instance, a state machine might ensure that signal A goes high before signal B can turn on (by transitioning states only when certain conditions on A’s node are met), thereby mimicking a protocol requirement or a timed sequence.

In summary, LTSpice state machines are useful whenever you need to simulate **state-dependent behavior**: any circuit that can be in different modes (and where the mode changes based on events) is a candidate. They provide a way to include high-level control algorithms (even ones that resemble software state machines) inside an analog simulation ([Power by Linear - Journal of Power Managment - V1N1 - January 2018 - What’s New with LTspice?](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/lt-journal-article/pbljournal-v1n1-2018-03-di-ltspice-gabinoalonso.pdf#:~:text=operates%20on%20data%20structures%20with,schematic%20as%20a%20SPICE%20directive)). This can significantly enhance the realism of simulations for circuits that interact with digital logic or have multi-step operations, without resorting to co-simulating a separate digital system.

## LTSpice State Machines Extension in VS Code

Developing LTSpice netlists (especially with the state machine syntax) in a text editor can be made easier with the right tools. Within **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, the *LTSpice State Machine* extension provides support specifically for editing these state machine constructs. This extension offers:

- **Syntax Highlighting**: The extension recognizes `.machine`, `.state`, `.rule`, `.output`, and `.endmachine` keywords and highlights them accordingly ([
        LTSpice State Machine - Visual Studio Marketplace
  ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TedKus.ltspice-state-machines#:~:text=This%20extension%20offers%20textual%20Highlights,the%20various%20State%20Machine%20elements)). This means your state machine code block will be color-coded, improving readability. Conditions and expressions may also be highlighted, making it easier to spot errors or mismatched parentheses in complex logic.

- **Snippet Suggestions**: Common patterns of the state machine language are provided as snippets ([
        LTSpice State Machine - Visual Studio Marketplace
  ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TedKus.ltspice-state-machines#:~:text=This%20extension%20offers%20textual%20Highlights,the%20various%20State%20Machine%20elements)). For example, as you start typing a `.state` or `.rule`, the editor might suggest a template (with placeholders for state names or conditions). There are also snippets for entire blocks (like quickly laying out a basic `.machine` ... `.endmachine` structure with sections for states, rules, and outputs). This saves time and helps ensure you use the correct syntax for each element.

- **Contraption Language Support**: Since LTSpice’s state machine uses a mini language for its logic (with if-then conditions, comparisons, etc.), the extension is aware of this “contraption” programming context ([
        LTSpice State Machine - Visual Studio Marketplace
  ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TedKus.ltspice-state-machines#:~:text=LTspice%20XVII%20includes%20an%20arbitrary,There%20are%20five%20commands)). It doesn’t turn VS Code into a simulator, but it recognizes the grammar so that features like bracket matching and comment toggling work properly inside the `.machine` block. For instance, the extension knows that `.machine` is closed by `.endmachine`, and it can highlight any missing or extra keywords.

- **Reference Documentation**: The extension’s marketplace page and README link to official or community documentation (like the LTwiki help page for `.machine`) ([
        LTSpice State Machine - Visual Studio Marketplace
  ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TedKus.ltspice-state-machines#:~:text=For%20more%20details%20on%20LTSpice%2C,htm)). This makes it convenient to find more details on the state machine syntax if needed. The README itself outlines the five commands that make up a state machine in LTSpice ([
        LTSpice State Machine - Visual Studio Marketplace
  ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TedKus.ltspice-state-machines#:~:text=LTspice%20XVII%20includes%20an%20arbitrary,There%20are%20five%20commands)), which can be a handy quick reference while coding.

Using this extension, LTSpice users can write complex state machines in VS Code with confidence that the syntax is correct. The immediate visual feedback helps catch mistakes (e.g., forgetting an `.endmachine` or mistyping a keyword) early. It essentially enhances the LTSpice development workflow by bringing modern IDE features (like highlighting and code completion) to the SPICE netlist domain. This is especially helpful for teams or individuals who manage LTSpice projects in text form (perhaps under version control) rather than solely using LTSpice’s GUI. Keep in mind that to actually run the simulation, you still need LTSpice itself – but you can edit and review the files in VS Code, then switch to LTSpice (or use command-line invocation) to simulate.

*Aside:* In addition to the state-machine-specific extension, there are more general LTSpice/SPICE extensions for VS Code. For example, one popular extension simply called “SPICE” provides basic language support (syntax highlighting for SPICE netlists, component identifiers, and common commands like `.tran`, `.ac`, `.model`, etc.) ([
        SPICE - Visual Studio Marketplace
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xuanli.spice#:~:text=Done)). That extension also includes some general SPICE snippets (for analysis commands and measurements). The state machine extension augments this by focusing on the newer `.machine` syntax that the general highlighters may not fully cover. Using them together, VS Code can become a powerful editor for nearly all aspects of LTSpice netlist coding.

## Other Editor Extensions and Tools for LTSpice Development

Beyond VS Code, there are several other editors and tools that can assist with writing and managing LTSpice simulations. Here are a few noteworthy ones:

- **Sublime Text – SPICE Package**: Sublime Text users can install the *SPICE for Sublime* package, which adds support for SPICE netlist syntax ([GitHub - leoheck/sublime-spice: SPICE for Sublime Text](https://github.com/leoheck/sublime-spice#:~:text=SPICE%20,spi)). This package works with standard SPICE dialects (PSPICE, HSPICE, LTSpice, etc.) and provides features like syntax highlighting (keywords, comments, values) and the ability to toggle comments easily. It even includes some snippets for common SPICE constructs ([GitHub - leoheck/sublime-spice: SPICE for Sublime Text](https://github.com/leoheck/sublime-spice#:~:text=)). Using Sublime’s powerful editing capabilities with this plugin can make writing LTSpice `.cir` files more convenient.

- **Vim – Spice Syntax Highlighting**: For those who prefer Vim, there is a simple Vim plugin (or vim config) called *vim-spice* that offers syntax highlighting for SPICE netlists ([
        SPICE - Visual Studio Marketplace
  ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xuanli.spice#:~:text=SPICE%20support%20for%20VSCode)). Once installed, it will color-code SPICE elements, dot commands, and comments when you open a file (for example, with extensions like `.cir` or `.sp`). This doesn’t provide autocomplete, but it does improve readability. Since Vim is often used for coding, having SPICE support means you can stick to your familiar environment while editing LTSpice files.

- **Emacs – Spice Mode**: Emacs has a major mode for SPICE deck editing called **spice-mode**. This mode supports various SPICE variants (Berkeley SPICE, HSPICE, etc.) and by extension covers LTSpice syntax as well ([GitHub - emacsmirror/spice-mode: Major mode for SPICE](https://github.com/emacsmirror/spice-mode#:~:text=%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D)). In Emacs spice-mode, SPICE keywords and cards are highlighted, and it may offer conveniences like indenting or templates for common commands. Emacs users can enable this mode to turn on proper highlighting for files with .sp or .cir extensions. The mode is quite mature and even supports vendor-specific extensions to SPICE ([GitHub - emacsmirror/spice-mode: Major mode for SPICE](https://github.com/emacsmirror/spice-mode#:~:text=This%20package%20provides%20an%20%28X%29Emacs2,also%20turn%20on%20Eldo)), which helps when working with LTSpice-specific directives.

- **Notepad++ – User-Defined Language for SPICE**: Notepad++ doesn’t have built-in SPICE support, but users have created *User Defined Language (UDL)* files to fill the gap. By importing a SPICE UDL (an XML file), you can get SPICE syntax highlighting in Notepad++ ([GitHub - hildogjr/Notepad-plus-plus--languages: Notepad++ highlighting languages (SPICE & RPN/RLP/Lisp/HP50g)](https://github.com/hildogjr/Notepad-plus-plus--languages#:~:text=Spice%20Language%20Syntax%20Highlighting%20on,Notepad)). For example, one such UDL will recognize .lib, .cir, .mod file extensions and apply coloring to element names (R, C, V, etc.), numbers, and dot commands. This is a lighter-weight solution, but for Windows users who already use Notepad++ for text editing, it can integrate LTSpice netlist editing into their workflow without needing a separate IDE.

- **Atom – SPICE Language Support**: Atom editor (while now deprecated) has a community package **language-spice-atom** that provides SPICE file support ([GitHub - Bollos00/language-spice-atom: SPICE language support for Atom text editor](https://github.com/Bollos00/language-spice-atom#:~:text=SPICE%20language%20support%20for%20Atom,Text%20Editor)). It offers syntax highlighting and some snippets for SPICE, similar to the Sublime and VS Code packages. If you happen to use Atom, installing this package would give you a decent LTSpice editing experience. (Note: Atom’s package ecosystem is no longer actively maintained since Atom was sunset in 2022, but the package can still be used if you have Atom.)

Each of these tools enhances the text-based development of LTSpice simulations. They don’t replace LTSpice’s own schematic editor or waveform viewer, but they make it easier to write and maintain netlist files, especially for large or complex simulations where using a code editor can be more efficient. By using editor extensions, you gain advantages like version control friendliness, multi-cursor editing, and integration with other text-processing tools – all while having SPICE-specific language support (so you’re less likely to make syntax errors such as typos in a .op directive or a missing parameter in a B-source).

In summary, LTSpice’s state machine feature greatly expands what you can simulate by enabling finite state logic within analog simulations. With the help of modern code editors and extensions, you can develop these state machines and other LTSpice netlists more productively. Whether in VS Code with the LTSpice State Machines extension ([
        LTSpice State Machine - Visual Studio Marketplace
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TedKus.ltspice-state-machines#:~:text=This%20extension%20offers%20textual%20Highlights,the%20various%20State%20Machine%20elements)), or in other editors like Sublime Text ([GitHub - leoheck/sublime-spice: SPICE for Sublime Text](https://github.com/leoheck/sublime-spice#:~:text=)), Vim ([
        SPICE - Visual Studio Marketplace
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xuanli.spice#:~:text=SPICE%20support%20for%20VSCode)), or Emacs ([GitHub - emacsmirror/spice-mode: Major mode for SPICE](https://github.com/emacsmirror/spice-mode#:~:text=%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D)), there are plenty of options to create a comfortable LTSpice coding environment. This combination of LTSpice’s powerful simulation capabilities and supportive editing tools allows engineers to prototype and test intricate mixed-signal designs all in one coherent workflow.
